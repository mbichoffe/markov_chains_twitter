Set aside the Q of whether Flake will back up his words with action. The words themselves aren't taken seriously unless they're in ALL CAPS.
It's one of Flake's core problems. He sees himself as fighting for his party's soul—but he doesn't like to fight https://t.co/x1C9CxbbiV

As someone who's interviewed him a few times, I can confirm (much to my occasional frustration!) that Flake is not a bomb-thrower by nature.
I doubt that's because Flake wants to take back his criticism of Trump. But talking like this about anyone does *not* come naturally to him.
Chris Matthews repeatedly tries—and fails—to get Flake to go after Trump in the same colorful terms and aggressive tone he uses in his book.

@brianefallon The argument is literally that "voting with Trump" (i.e. voting for GOP legislation) is the only valid "action against Trump"
@jbarro Me too, actually! (Well, not a "takedown" exactly, but...)
But saying, "All criticism of Trump is invalid unless the critics supports Democratic domestic policies" is incoherent.
And of course there's plenty of reasonable criticism of the conservative votes on their own merits.
If you want to call GOP lawmakers out for failing to hold Trump accountable, there's plenty to point to!
Conservative politicians vote for conservative legislation because they're conservatives. That shouldn't invalidate their criticism of Trump

Getting rid of Mueller would shift pressure fully back onto congress to investigate. And Republicans most definitely don't want that.
Given how congressional GOP has behaved so far, I wouldn't hold my breath for any kind of serious punitive response to Muller's firing. But!
Firing Mueller would strip congressional Republicans of their favorite rhetorical shield: "We need to wait for results of the investigation"

Obviously a lot of what Trump says is posturing. But I think he genuinely believed fixing healthcare, the tax code, et al would be simple.
Trump's contempt for politicians as a class convinced him that what they do is extremely easy. As it turns out, it's not!
It's not just that Trump came into office knowing very little abt policy—it's that his ignorance emboldened him, instead of restraining him.
So a lot of you are (understandably!) taking pleasure in RTing this. But I actually think it helps explain one reason Trump's so bad at this

Trying to determine the last story I wrote that didn't include Trump's name in it.
Repubs on Capitol Hill really need to grapple with the likelihood that Trump is probably going to do this if they don't start speaking up.
Anyway, that's the cynical case for congressional Republicans to speak up now and make firing Mueller as difficult as possible for Trump.
@oblivious_dude Yes, I understand that. If Trump decides he wants to do it, you really think he would care whether Rosenstein sticks around?
Best-case scenario for congressional Rs seems to be: Let Mueller investigation play out, hope it takes a while, pass legislation in meantime
There's no telling what will happen if Trump fired Mueller, but it seems pretty unlikely it would help the GOP's legislative agenda.
Set aside the debate about Repubs' courage/principles/morality. Isn't it in their self-interest to keep Mueller's investigation going?
If congressional Repubs actually want to stop this from happening, they're going to have to make clear there will be consequences for Trump.

Remember when people used to think every bad thing Trump did was a calculated distraction from the last bad thing Trump did?
(To be clear, this is not a very likely scenario.)
Seems like the most likely pre-midterms impeachment scenario is Mitch McConnell deciding he's sick of dealing with Trump stuff.
But if this *does* end up being the breaking point for Repubs on Capitol Hill—a big if!—it'll likely be because of the threat of more memos.
Obviously Chaffetz has more flexibility since he's on his way out, so we'll have to watch for other GOP leaders' reactions over next 24 hrs.
RT @RosieGray: whoa https://t.co/J0mh883Kk0

Pilot, 45 minutes into 10-hour flight: "I have to confess, I didn't quite realize how complicated this would be..."
"I thought it would be easier" is really not what you're hoping to hear from the guy you just hired for the most important job in the world.

After all the tough talk &amp; iconoclastic rhetoric during the campaign, Trump has been repeatedly brought to heel by the people he ran against
Meanwhile, every time Trump *does* pick a fight w/ establishment he loses, backs down, or gets distracted and wanders on to something else.
He's let GOP leaders in Congress effectively take over his agenda, and he's let establishment types talk him out of major campaign promises.

In my liberal MA suburb, I remember the "civil war wasn't about slavery" theory being raised to push back against idolization of Lincoln.

I have a vivid memory of hearing it in high school from a friend who thought it sounded savvy and contrarian.

Set aside the Q of whether Flake will back up his words with action. The words themselves aren't taken seriously unless they're in ALL CAPS.
It's one of Flake's core problems. He sees himself as fighting for his party's soul—but he doesn't like to fight https://t.co/x1C9CxbbiV
This seems to frustrate many of Flake's constituents as well. https://t.co/x1C9CxbbiV https://t.co/Cz2C8EhnFr
As someone who's interviewed him a few times, I can confirm (much to my occasional frustration!) that Flake is not a bomb-thrower by nature.
I doubt that's because Flake wants to take back his criticism of Trump. But talking like this about anyone does *not* come naturally to him.
Chris Matthews repeatedly tries—and fails—to get Flake to go after Trump in the same colorful terms and aggressive tone he uses in his book.

@brianefallon The argument is literally that "voting with Trump" (i.e. voting for GOP legislation) is the only valid "action against Trump"
@jbarro Me too, actually! (Well, not a "takedown" exactly, but...)
But saying, "All criticism of Trump is invalid unless the critics supports Democratic domestic policies" is incoherent.
And of course there's plenty of reasonable criticism of the conservative votes on their own merits.
If you want to call GOP lawmakers out for failing to hold Trump accountable, there's plenty to point to!
Conservative politicians vote for conservative legislation because they're conservatives. That shouldn't invalidate their criticism of Trump

Getting rid of Mueller would shift pressure fully back onto congress to investigate. And Republicans most definitely don't want that.
Given how congressional GOP has behaved so far, I wouldn't hold my breath for any kind of serious punitive response to Muller's firing. But!
Firing Mueller would strip congressional Republicans of their favorite rhetorical shield: "We need to wait for results of the investigation"

Obviously a lot of what Trump says is posturing. But I think he genuinely believed fixing healthcare, the tax code, et al would be simple.
Trump's contempt for politicians as a class convinced him that what they do is extremely easy. As it turns out, it's not!
It's not just that Trump came into office knowing very little abt policy—it's that his ignorance emboldened him, instead of restraining him.
So a lot of you are (understandably!) taking pleasure in RTing this. But I actually think it helps explain one reason Trump's so bad at this

Trying to determine the last story I wrote that didn't include Trump's name in it.
Repubs on Capitol Hill really need to grapple with the likelihood that Trump is probably going to do this if they don't start speaking up.
Anyway, that's the cynical case for congressional Republicans to speak up now and make firing Mueller as difficult as possible for Trump.
@oblivious_dude Yes, I understand that. If Trump decides he wants to do it, you really think he would care whether Rosenstein sticks around?
Best-case scenario for congressional Rs seems to be: Let Mueller investigation play out, hope it takes a while, pass legislation in meantime
There's no telling what will happen if Trump fired Mueller, but it seems pretty unlikely it would help the GOP's legislative agenda.
Set aside the debate about Repubs' courage/principles/morality. Isn't it in their self-interest to keep Mueller's investigation going?
If congressional Repubs actually want to stop this from happening, they're going to have to make clear there will be consequences for Trump.

Remember when people used to think every bad thing Trump did was a calculated distraction from the last bad thing Trump did?
(To be clear, this is not a very likely scenario.)
Seems like the most likely pre-midterms impeachment scenario is Mitch McConnell deciding he's sick of dealing with Trump stuff.
But if this *does* end up being the breaking point for Repubs on Capitol Hill—a big if!—it'll likely be because of the threat of more memos.
Obviously Chaffetz has more flexibility since he's on his way out, so we'll have to watch for other GOP leaders' reactions over next 24 hrs.
RT @RosieGray: whoa https://t.co/J0mh883Kk0

Pilot, 45 minutes into 10-hour flight: "I have to confess, I didn't quite realize how complicated this would be..."
"I thought it would be easier" is really not what you're hoping to hear from the guy you just hired for the most important job in the world.

After all the tough talk &amp; iconoclastic rhetoric during the campaign, Trump has been repeatedly brought to heel by the people he ran against
Meanwhile, every time Trump *does* pick a fight w/ establishment he loses, backs down, or gets distracted and wanders on to something else.
He's let GOP leaders in Congress effectively take over his agenda, and he's let establishment types talk him out of major campaign promises.

In my liberal MA suburb, I remember the "civil war wasn't about slavery" theory being raised to push back against idolization of Lincoln.

I have a vivid memory of hearing it in high school from a friend who thought it sounded savvy and contrarian.

Set aside the Q of whether Flake will back up his words with action. The words themselves aren't taken seriously unless they're in ALL CAPS.
It's one of Flake's core problems. He sees himself as fighting for his party's soul—but he doesn't like to fight https://t.co/x1C9CxbbiV
This seems to frustrate many of Flake's constituents as well. https://t.co/x1C9CxbbiV https://t.co/Cz2C8EhnFr
As someone who's interviewed him a few times, I can confirm (much to my occasional frustration!) that Flake is not a bomb-thrower by nature.
I doubt that's because Flake wants to take back his criticism of Trump. But talking like this about anyone does *not* come naturally to him.
Chris Matthews repeatedly tries—and fails—to get Flake to go after Trump in the same colorful terms and aggressive tone he uses in his book.

@brianefallon The argument is literally that "voting with Trump" (i.e. voting for GOP legislation) is the only valid "action against Trump"
@jbarro Me too, actually! (Well, not a "takedown" exactly, but...)
But saying, "All criticism of Trump is invalid unless the critics supports Democratic domestic policies" is incoherent.
And of course there's plenty of reasonable criticism of the conservative votes on their own merits.
If you want to call GOP lawmakers out for failing to hold Trump accountable, there's plenty to point to!
Conservative politicians vote for conservative legislation because they're conservatives. That shouldn't invalidate their criticism of Trump

Getting rid of Mueller would shift pressure fully back onto congress to investigate. And Republicans most definitely don't want that.
Given how congressional GOP has behaved so far, I wouldn't hold my breath for any kind of serious punitive response to Muller's firing. But!
Firing Mueller would strip congressional Republicans of their favorite rhetorical shield: "We need to wait for results of the investigation"

Obviously a lot of what Trump says is posturing. But I think he genuinely believed fixing healthcare, the tax code, et al would be simple.
Trump's contempt for politicians as a class convinced him that what they do is extremely easy. As it turns out, it's not!
It's not just that Trump came into office knowing very little abt policy—it's that his ignorance emboldened him, instead of restraining him.
So a lot of you are (understandably!) taking pleasure in RTing this. But I actually think it helps explain one reason Trump's so bad at this

Trying to determine the last story I wrote that didn't include Trump's name in it.
Repubs on Capitol Hill really need to grapple with the likelihood that Trump is probably going to do this if they don't start speaking up.
Anyway, that's the cynical case for congressional Republicans to speak up now and make firing Mueller as difficult as possible for Trump.
@oblivious_dude Yes, I understand that. If Trump decides he wants to do it, you really think he would care whether Rosenstein sticks around?
Best-case scenario for congressional Rs seems to be: Let Mueller investigation play out, hope it takes a while, pass legislation in meantime
There's no telling what will happen if Trump fired Mueller, but it seems pretty unlikely it would help the GOP's legislative agenda.
Set aside the debate about Repubs' courage/principles/morality. Isn't it in their self-interest to keep Mueller's investigation going?
If congressional Repubs actually want to stop this from happening, they're going to have to make clear there will be consequences for Trump.

Remember when people used to think every bad thing Trump did was a calculated distraction from the last bad thing Trump did?
(To be clear, this is not a very likely scenario.)
Seems like the most likely pre-midterms impeachment scenario is Mitch McConnell deciding he's sick of dealing with Trump stuff.
But if this *does* end up being the breaking point for Repubs on Capitol Hill—a big if!—it'll likely be because of the threat of more memos.
Obviously Chaffetz has more flexibility since he's on his way out, so we'll have to watch for other GOP leaders' reactions over next 24 hrs.
RT @RosieGray: whoa https://t.co/J0mh883Kk0

Pilot, 45 minutes into 10-hour flight: "I have to confess, I didn't quite realize how complicated this would be..."
"I thought it would be easier" is really not what you're hoping to hear from the guy you just hired for the most important job in the world.

After all the tough talk &amp; iconoclastic rhetoric during the campaign, Trump has been repeatedly brought to heel by the people he ran against
Meanwhile, every time Trump *does* pick a fight w/ establishment he loses, backs down, or gets distracted and wanders on to something else.
He's let GOP leaders in Congress effectively take over his agenda, and he's let establishment types talk him out of major campaign promises.

(Again, I think proponents thought it made them seem savvy, even woke.)
In my liberal MA suburb, I remember the "civil war wasn't about slavery" theory being raised to push back against idolization of Lincoln.
I grew up in MA and didn't hear much Lost Cause stuff. As far as I remember, the Confederates were always broadly cast as the bad guys.
I have a vivid memory of hearing it in high school from a friend who thought it sounded savvy and contrarian.
The more I think about it, the more I realize how often I've been exposed to the "actually, the Civil War wasn't REALLY about slavey" idea.

Set aside the Q of whether Flake will back up his words with action. The words themselves aren't taken seriously unless they're in ALL CAPS.
It's one of Flake's core problems. He sees himself as fighting for his party's soul—but he doesn't like to fight https://t.co/x1C9CxbbiV
This seems to frustrate many of Flake's constituents as well. https://t.co/x1C9CxbbiV https://t.co/Cz2C8EhnFr
As someone who's interviewed him a few times, I can confirm (much to my occasional frustration!) that Flake is not a bomb-thrower by nature.
I doubt that's because Flake wants to take back his criticism of Trump. But talking like this about anyone does *not* come naturally to him.
Chris Matthews repeatedly tries—and fails—to get Flake to go after Trump in the same colorful terms and aggressive tone he uses in his book.

@brianefallon The argument is literally that "voting with Trump" (i.e. voting for GOP legislation) is the only valid "action against Trump"
@jbarro Me too, actually! (Well, not a "takedown" exactly, but...)
But saying, "All criticism of Trump is invalid unless the critics supports Democratic domestic policies" is incoherent.
And of course there's plenty of reasonable criticism of the conservative votes on their own merits.
If you want to call GOP lawmakers out for failing to hold Trump accountable, there's plenty to point to!
Conservative politicians vote for conservative legislation because they're conservatives. That shouldn't invalidate their criticism of Trump

Firing Mueller would strip congressional Republicans of their favorite rhetorical shield: "We need to wait for results of the investigation"

McConnell: "This has been a very, very challenging experience for all of us. It's pretty obvious we don't have 50 members who can agree..."

Trying to determine the last story I wrote that didn't include Trump's name in it.
Repubs on Capitol Hill really need to grapple with the likelihood that Trump is probably going to do this if they don't start speaking up.
Anyway, that's the cynical case for congressional Republicans to speak up now and make firing Mueller as difficult as possible for Trump.
@oblivious_dude Yes, I understand that. If Trump decides he wants to do it, you really think he would care whether Rosenstein sticks around?
Best-case scenario for congressional Rs seems to be: Let Mueller investigation play out, hope it takes a while, pass legislation in meantime
There's no telling what will happen if Trump fired Mueller, but it seems pretty unlikely it would help the GOP's legislative agenda.
Set aside the debate about Repubs' courage/principles/morality. Isn't it in their self-interest to keep Mueller's investigation going?
If congressional Repubs actually want to stop this from happening, they're going to have to make clear there will be consequences for Trump.

Remember when people used to think every bad thing Trump did was a calculated distraction from the last bad thing Trump did?
(To be clear, this is not a very likely scenario.)
Seems like the most likely pre-midterms impeachment scenario is Mitch McConnell deciding he's sick of dealing with Trump stuff.
But if this *does* end up being the breaking point for Repubs on Capitol Hill—a big if!—it'll likely be because of the threat of more memos.
Obviously Chaffetz has more flexibility since he's on his way out, so we'll have to watch for other GOP leaders' reactions over next 24 hrs.
RT @RosieGray: whoa https://t.co/J0mh883Kk0

Can't tell if I'm just in one of those moods where I read every Trump quote like it's dripping with pathos, or if he really sounds that sad.
To be fair, I'm sure every POTUS is humbled by the challenges of the office. But most prob didn't assume it'd be cushier than their last gig
Pilot, 45 minutes into 10-hour flight: "I have to confess, I didn't quite realize how complicated this would be..."
"I thought it would be easier" is really not what you're hoping to hear from the guy you just hired for the most important job in the world.

After all the tough talk &amp; iconoclastic rhetoric during the campaign, Trump has been repeatedly brought to heel by the people he ran against
Meanwhile, every time Trump *does* pick a fight w/ establishment he loses, backs down, or gets distracted and wanders on to something else.
He's let GOP leaders in Congress effectively take over his agenda, and he's let establishment types talk him out of major campaign promises.

(Again, I think proponents thought it made them seem savvy, even woke.)
In my liberal MA suburb, I remember the "civil war wasn't about slavery" theory being raised to push back against idolization of Lincoln.
I grew up in MA and didn't hear much Lost Cause stuff. As far as I remember, the Confederates were always broadly cast as the bad guys.
I have a vivid memory of hearing it in high school from a friend who thought it sounded savvy and contrarian.
The more I think about it, the more I realize how often I've been exposed to the "actually, the Civil War wasn't REALLY about slavey" idea.

Set aside the Q of whether Flake will back up his words with action. The words themselves aren't taken seriously unless they're in ALL CAPS.
It's one of Flake's core problems. He sees himself as fighting for his party's soul—but he doesn't like to fight https://t.co/x1C9CxbbiV
This seems to frustrate many of Flake's constituents as well. https://t.co/x1C9CxbbiV https://t.co/Cz2C8EhnFr
As someone who's interviewed him a few times, I can confirm (much to my occasional frustration!) that Flake is not a bomb-thrower by nature.
I doubt that's because Flake wants to take back his criticism of Trump. But talking like this about anyone does *not* come naturally to him.
Chris Matthews repeatedly tries—and fails—to get Flake to go after Trump in the same colorful terms and aggressive tone he uses in his book.

@brianefallon The argument is literally that "voting with Trump" (i.e. voting for GOP legislation) is the only valid "action against Trump"
@jbarro Me too, actually! (Well, not a "takedown" exactly, but...)
But saying, "All criticism of Trump is invalid unless the critics supports Democratic domestic policies" is incoherent.
And of course there's plenty of reasonable criticism of the conservative votes on their own merits.
If you want to call GOP lawmakers out for failing to hold Trump accountable, there's plenty to point to!
Conservative politicians vote for conservative legislation because they're conservatives. That shouldn't invalidate their criticism of Trump

Trump seems to really like this (totally unworkable) idea. https://t.co/Mc518VXVcn

(Caveat: He might still have a plan.)

Trying to determine the last story I wrote that didn't include Trump's name in it.
Repubs on Capitol Hill really need to grapple with the likelihood that Trump is probably going to do this if they don't start speaking up.
Anyway, that's the cynical case for congressional Republicans to speak up now and make firing Mueller as difficult as possible for Trump.
@oblivious_dude Yes, I understand that. If Trump decides he wants to do it, you really think he would care whether Rosenstein sticks around?
Best-case scenario for congressional Rs seems to be: Let Mueller investigation play out, hope it takes a while, pass legislation in meantime
There's no telling what will happen if Trump fired Mueller, but it seems pretty unlikely it would help the GOP's legislative agenda.
Set aside the debate about Repubs' courage/principles/morality. Isn't it in their self-interest to keep Mueller's investigation going?
If congressional Repubs actually want to stop this from happening, they're going to have to make clear there will be consequences for Trump.

Remember when people used to think every bad thing Trump did was a calculated distraction from the last bad thing Trump did?
(To be clear, this is not a very likely scenario.)
Seems like the most likely pre-midterms impeachment scenario is Mitch McConnell deciding he's sick of dealing with Trump stuff.
But if this *does* end up being the breaking point for Repubs on Capitol Hill—a big if!—it'll likely be because of the threat of more memos.
Obviously Chaffetz has more flexibility since he's on his way out, so we'll have to watch for other GOP leaders' reactions over next 24 hrs.
RT @RosieGray: whoa https://t.co/J0mh883Kk0

To be fair, I'm sure every POTUS is humbled by the challenges of the office. But most prob didn't assume it'd be cushier than their last gig
Pilot, 45 minutes into 10-hour flight: "I have to confess, I didn't quite realize how complicated this would be..."
"I thought it would be easier" is really not what you're hoping to hear from the guy you just hired for the most important job in the world.

After all the tough talk &amp; iconoclastic rhetoric during the campaign, Trump has been repeatedly brought to heel by the people he ran against
Meanwhile, every time Trump *does* pick a fight w/ establishment he loses, backs down, or gets distracted and wanders on to something else.
He's let GOP leaders in Congress effectively take over his agenda, and he's let establishment types talk him out of major campaign promises.

(Again, I think proponents thought it made them seem savvy, even woke.)
In my liberal MA suburb, I remember the "civil war wasn't about slavery" theory being raised to push back against idolization of Lincoln.
I grew up in MA and didn't hear much Lost Cause stuff. As far as I remember, the Confederates were always broadly cast as the bad guys.
I have a vivid memory of hearing it in high school from a friend who thought it sounded savvy and contrarian.
The more I think about it, the more I realize how often I've been exposed to the "actually, the Civil War wasn't REALLY about slavey" idea.

Set aside the Q of whether Flake will back up his words with action. The words themselves aren't taken seriously unless they're in ALL CAPS.
It's one of Flake's core problems. He sees himself as fighting for his party's soul—but he doesn't like to fight https://t.co/x1C9CxbbiV
This seems to frustrate many of Flake's constituents as well. https://t.co/x1C9CxbbiV https://t.co/Cz2C8EhnFr
As someone who's interviewed him a few times, I can confirm (much to my occasional frustration!) that Flake is not a bomb-thrower by nature.
I doubt that's because Flake wants to take back his criticism of Trump. But talking like this about anyone does *not* come naturally to him.
Chris Matthews repeatedly tries—and fails—to get Flake to go after Trump in the same colorful terms and aggressive tone he uses in his book.

@brianefallon The argument is literally that "voting with Trump" (i.e. voting for GOP legislation) is the only valid "action against Trump"
@jbarro Me too, actually! (Well, not a "takedown" exactly, but...)
But saying, "All criticism of Trump is invalid unless the critics supports Democratic domestic policies" is incoherent.
And of course there's plenty of reasonable criticism of the conservative votes on their own merits.
If you want to call GOP lawmakers out for failing to hold Trump accountable, there's plenty to point to!
Conservative politicians vote for conservative legislation because they're conservatives. That shouldn't invalidate their criticism of Trump

Trying to determine the last story I wrote that didn't include Trump's name in it.
Repubs on Capitol Hill really need to grapple with the likelihood that Trump is probably going to do this if they don't start speaking up.
Anyway, that's the cynical case for congressional Republicans to speak up now and make firing Mueller as difficult as possible for Trump.
@oblivious_dude Yes, I understand that. If Trump decides he wants to do it, you really think he would care whether Rosenstein sticks around?
Best-case scenario for congressional Rs seems to be: Let Mueller investigation play out, hope it takes a while, pass legislation in meantime
There's no telling what will happen if Trump fired Mueller, but it seems pretty unlikely it would help the GOP's legislative agenda.
Set aside the debate about Repubs' courage/principles/morality. Isn't it in their self-interest to keep Mueller's investigation going?
If congressional Repubs actually want to stop this from happening, they're going to have to make clear there will be consequences for Trump.

According to my proprietary hypothetical statistical model, there is a roughly .02% chance that Clinton would have fired Comey if she won.
Would you have been fired if Clinton were POTUS?
That's a great Q. Yeah I don't know. I don't know. 
Any thoughts on it?
I don't know.

@KeepItRealist @oliverdarcy i'm not sure "the crusades need to come back" is an issue with two reasonable points of view
Part of it was just the cliche getting overused. But it was also the view of Trump shifting from entertainer to real presidential contender.
I used it far too often throughout the summer and fall of 2015, and started using it much less as the primaries got closer.

Remember when people used to think every bad thing Trump did was a calculated distraction from the last bad thing Trump did?
(To be clear, this is not a very likely scenario.)
Seems like the most likely pre-midterms impeachment scenario is Mitch McConnell deciding he's sick of dealing with Trump stuff.
But if this *does* end up being the breaking point for Repubs on Capitol Hill—a big if!—it'll likely be because of the threat of more memos.
Obviously Chaffetz has more flexibility since he's on his way out, so we'll have to watch for other GOP leaders' reactions over next 24 hrs.
RT @RosieGray: whoa https://t.co/J0mh883Kk0
One of the most predictable patterns of the Trump presidency has been congressional Repubs' reaction (or lack thereof) to these scandals.

Spicer repeatedly refuses to answer questions about whether Trump is recording conversations that take place in the White House.
"The tweet speaks for itself," says Sean Spicer.

Can't tell if I'm just in one of those moods where I read every Trump quote like it's dripping with pathos, or if he really sounds that sad.
To be fair, I'm sure every POTUS is humbled by the challenges of the office. But most prob didn't assume it'd be cushier than their last gig
Pilot, 45 minutes into 10-hour flight: "I have to confess, I didn't quite realize how complicated this would be..."
"I thought it would be easier" is really not what you're hoping to hear from the guy you just hired for the most important job in the world.
Promise him a spot on Mount Rushmore, doctor up some historically high approval ratings, and I bet you could convince Trump to retire now.

After all the tough talk &amp; iconoclastic rhetoric during the campaign, Trump has been repeatedly brought to heel by the people he ran against
Meanwhile, every time Trump *does* pick a fight w/ establishment he loses, backs down, or gets distracted and wanders on to something else.
He's let GOP leaders in Congress effectively take over his agenda, and he's let establishment types talk him out of major campaign promises.

(Again, I think proponents thought it made them seem savvy, even woke.)
In my liberal MA suburb, I remember the "civil war wasn't about slavery" theory being raised to push back against idolization of Lincoln.
I grew up in MA and didn't hear much Lost Cause stuff. As far as I remember, the Confederates were always broadly cast as the bad guys.
I have a vivid memory of hearing it in high school from a friend who thought it sounded savvy and contrarian.
The more I think about it, the more I realize how often I've been exposed to the "actually, the Civil War wasn't REALLY about slavey" idea.

But I guess we'll find out soon! (That is, if Matheson decides to run). Again, I expect the "draft Romney" efforts to intensify.

Set aside the Q of whether Flake will back up his words with action. The words themselves aren't taken seriously unless they're in ALL CAPS.
It's one of Flake's core problems. He sees himself as fighting for his party's soul—but he doesn't like to fight https://t.co/x1C9CxbbiV
This seems to frustrate many of Flake's constituents as well. https://t.co/x1C9CxbbiV https://t.co/Cz2C8EhnFr
As someone who's interviewed him a few times, I can confirm (much to my occasional frustration!) that Flake is not a bomb-thrower by nature.
I doubt that's because Flake wants to take back his criticism of Trump. But talking like this about anyone does *not* come naturally to him.
Chris Matthews repeatedly tries—and fails—to get Flake to go after Trump in the same colorful terms and aggressive tone he uses in his book.

@brianefallon The argument is literally that "voting with Trump" (i.e. voting for GOP legislation) is the only valid "action against Trump"
@jbarro Me too, actually! (Well, not a "takedown" exactly, but...)
But saying, "All criticism of Trump is invalid unless the critics supports Democratic domestic policies" is incoherent.
And of course there's plenty of reasonable criticism of the conservative votes on their own merits.
If you want to call GOP lawmakers out for failing to hold Trump accountable, there's plenty to point to!
Conservative politicians vote for conservative legislation because they're conservatives. That shouldn't invalidate their criticism of Trump

@mollyesque @RosieGray *living on the beach* seems pretty nice! *visiting the beach* is not nice.
Collusion? Ridiculous!
There's no evidence of collusion.
Any collusion was inadvertent.

If you have young children, beaches are slightly more bearable. But even then, only for an extremely limited amount of time.

Trying to determine the last story I wrote that didn't include Trump's name in it.
Repubs on Capitol Hill really need to grapple with the likelihood that Trump is probably going to do this if they don't start speaking up.
Anyway, that's the cynical case for congressional Republicans to speak up now and make firing Mueller as difficult as possible for Trump.
@oblivious_dude Yes, I understand that. If Trump decides he wants to do it, you really think he would care whether Rosenstein sticks around?
Best-case scenario for congressional Rs seems to be: Let Mueller investigation play out, hope it takes a while, pass legislation in meantime
There's no telling what will happen if Trump fired Mueller, but it seems pretty unlikely it would help the GOP's legislative agenda.
Set aside the debate about Repubs' courage/principles/morality. Isn't it in their self-interest to keep Mueller's investigation going?
If congressional Repubs actually want to stop this from happening, they're going to have to make clear there will be consequences for Trump.

@KeepItRealist @oliverdarcy i'm not sure "the crusades need to come back" is an issue with two reasonable points of view
Part of it was just the cliche getting overused. But it was also the view of Trump shifting from entertainer to real presidential contender.
I used it far too often throughout the summer and fall of 2015, and started using it much less as the primaries got closer.

Remember when people used to think every bad thing Trump did was a calculated distraction from the last bad thing Trump did?
(To be clear, this is not a very likely scenario.)
Seems like the most likely pre-midterms impeachment scenario is Mitch McConnell deciding he's sick of dealing with Trump stuff.
But if this *does* end up being the breaking point for Repubs on Capitol Hill—a big if!—it'll likely be because of the threat of more memos.
Obviously Chaffetz has more flexibility since he's on his way out, so we'll have to watch for other GOP leaders' reactions over next 24 hrs.
RT @RosieGray: whoa https://t.co/J0mh883Kk0
One of the most predictable patterns of the Trump presidency has been congressional Repubs' reaction (or lack thereof) to these scandals.

Can't tell if I'm just in one of those moods where I read every Trump quote like it's dripping with pathos, or if he really sounds that sad.
To be fair, I'm sure every POTUS is humbled by the challenges of the office. But most prob didn't assume it'd be cushier than their last gig
Pilot, 45 minutes into 10-hour flight: "I have to confess, I didn't quite realize how complicated this would be..."
"I thought it would be easier" is really not what you're hoping to hear from the guy you just hired for the most important job in the world.
Promise him a spot on Mount Rushmore, doctor up some historically high approval ratings, and I bet you could convince Trump to retire now.

After all the tough talk &amp; iconoclastic rhetoric during the campaign, Trump has been repeatedly brought to heel by the people he ran against
Meanwhile, every time Trump *does* pick a fight w/ establishment he loses, backs down, or gets distracted and wanders on to something else.
He's let GOP leaders in Congress effectively take over his agenda, and he's let establishment types talk him out of major campaign promises.

Set aside the Q of whether Flake will back up his words with action. The words themselves aren't taken seriously unless they're in ALL CAPS.
It's one of Flake's core problems. He sees himself as fighting for his party's soul—but he doesn't like to fight https://t.co/x1C9CxbbiV
This seems to frustrate many of Flake's constituents as well. https://t.co/x1C9CxbbiV https://t.co/Cz2C8EhnFr
As someone who's interviewed him a few times, I can confirm (much to my occasional frustration!) that Flake is not a bomb-thrower by nature.
I doubt that's because Flake wants to take back his criticism of Trump. But talking like this about anyone does *not* come naturally to him.
Chris Matthews repeatedly tries—and fails—to get Flake to go after Trump in the same colorful terms and aggressive tone he uses in his book.
This interview is fascinating to watch, and I think gets at one of Flake's biggest disadvantages in the Trump era: https://t.co/RwptuK7ASp

@brianefallon The argument is literally that "voting with Trump" (i.e. voting for GOP legislation) is the only valid "action against Trump"
@jbarro Me too, actually! (Well, not a "takedown" exactly, but...)
But saying, "All criticism of Trump is invalid unless the critics supports Democratic domestic policies" is incoherent.
And of course there's plenty of reasonable criticism of the conservative votes on their own merits.
If you want to call GOP lawmakers out for failing to hold Trump accountable, there's plenty to point to!
Conservative politicians vote for conservative legislation because they're conservatives. That shouldn't invalidate their criticism of Trump

Getting rid of Mueller would shift pressure fully back onto congress to investigate. And Republicans most definitely don't want that.

Trying to determine the last story I wrote that didn't include Trump's name in it.
Repubs on Capitol Hill really need to grapple with the likelihood that Trump is probably going to do this if they don't start speaking up.
Anyway, that's the cynical case for congressional Republicans to speak up now and make firing Mueller as difficult as possible for Trump.
@oblivious_dude Yes, I understand that. If Trump decides he wants to do it, you really think he would care whether Rosenstein sticks around?
Best-case scenario for congressional Rs seems to be: Let Mueller investigation play out, hope it takes a while, pass legislation in meantime
There's no telling what will happen if Trump fired Mueller, but it seems pretty unlikely it would help the GOP's legislative agenda.
Set aside the debate about Repubs' courage/principles/morality. Isn't it in their self-interest to keep Mueller's investigation going?
If congressional Repubs actually want to stop this from happening, they're going to have to make clear there will be consequences for Trump.
If true, Ruddy probably expected more pushback from Republicans. If anything, the muted response has likely emboldened Trump.

@KeepItRealist @oliverdarcy i'm not sure "the crusades need to come back" is an issue with two reasonable points of view
Part of it was just the cliche getting overused. But it was also the view of Trump shifting from entertainer to real presidential contender.
I used it far too often throughout the summer and fall of 2015, and started using it much less as the primaries got closer.

Remember when people used to think every bad thing Trump did was a calculated distraction from the last bad thing Trump did?
(To be clear, this is not a very likely scenario.)
Seems like the most likely pre-midterms impeachment scenario is Mitch McConnell deciding he's sick of dealing with Trump stuff.
But if this *does* end up being the breaking point for Repubs on Capitol Hill—a big if!—it'll likely be because of the threat of more memos.
Obviously Chaffetz has more flexibility since he's on his way out, so we'll have to watch for other GOP leaders' reactions over next 24 hrs.
RT @RosieGray: whoa https://t.co/J0mh883Kk0
One of the most predictable patterns of the Trump presidency has been congressional Repubs' reaction (or lack thereof) to these scandals.

On the eve of his 100th day in office, Trump appears to be spiraling into presidential status anxiety. My story: https://t.co/1BqkShiNie
Can't tell if I'm just in one of those moods where I read every Trump quote like it's dripping with pathos, or if he really sounds that sad.
To be fair, I'm sure every POTUS is humbled by the challenges of the office. But most prob didn't assume it'd be cushier than their last gig
Pilot, 45 minutes into 10-hour flight: "I have to confess, I didn't quite realize how complicated this would be..."
"I thought it would be easier" is really not what you're hoping to hear from the guy you just hired for the most important job in the world.
Promise him a spot on Mount Rushmore, doctor up some historically high approval ratings, and I bet you could convince Trump to retire now.

After all the tough talk &amp; iconoclastic rhetoric during the campaign, Trump has been repeatedly brought to heel by the people he ran against
Meanwhile, every time Trump *does* pick a fight w/ establishment he loses, backs down, or gets distracted and wanders on to something else.
He's let GOP leaders in Congress effectively take over his agenda, and he's let establishment types talk him out of major campaign promises.
For a POTUS obsessed w/ asserting dominance/projecting strength, it's striking how many fights w/ "the swamp" Trump has lost in 1st 100 days

Set aside the Q of whether Flake will back up his words with action. The words themselves aren't taken seriously unless they're in ALL CAPS.
It's one of Flake's core problems. He sees himself as fighting for his party's soul—but he doesn't like to fight https://t.co/x1C9CxbbiV

As someone who's interviewed him a few times, I can confirm (much to my occasional frustration!) that Flake is not a bomb-thrower by nature.
I doubt that's because Flake wants to take back his criticism of Trump. But talking like this about anyone does *not* come naturally to him.
Chris Matthews repeatedly tries—and fails—to get Flake to go after Trump in the same colorful terms and aggressive tone he uses in his book.

@brianefallon The argument is literally that "voting with Trump" (i.e. voting for GOP legislation) is the only valid "action against Trump"
@jbarro Me too, actually! (Well, not a "takedown" exactly, but...)
But saying, "All criticism of Trump is invalid unless the critics supports Democratic domestic policies" is incoherent.
And of course there's plenty of reasonable criticism of the conservative votes on their own merits.
If you want to call GOP lawmakers out for failing to hold Trump accountable, there's plenty to point to!
Conservative politicians vote for conservative legislation because they're conservatives. That shouldn't invalidate their criticism of Trump

Trying to determine the last story I wrote that didn't include Trump's name in it.
Repubs on Capitol Hill really need to grapple with the likelihood that Trump is probably going to do this if they don't start speaking up.
Anyway, that's the cynical case for congressional Republicans to speak up now and make firing Mueller as difficult as possible for Trump.
@oblivious_dude Yes, I understand that. If Trump decides he wants to do it, you really think he would care whether Rosenstein sticks around?
Best-case scenario for congressional Rs seems to be: Let Mueller investigation play out, hope it takes a while, pass legislation in meantime
There's no telling what will happen if Trump fired Mueller, but it seems pretty unlikely it would help the GOP's legislative agenda.
Set aside the debate about Repubs' courage/principles/morality. Isn't it in their self-interest to keep Mueller's investigation going?
If congressional Repubs actually want to stop this from happening, they're going to have to make clear there will be consequences for Trump.
If true, Ruddy probably expected more pushback from Republicans. If anything, the muted response has likely emboldened Trump.

@KeepItRealist @oliverdarcy i'm not sure "the crusades need to come back" is an issue with two reasonable points of view
Part of it was just the cliche getting overused. But it was also the view of Trump shifting from entertainer to real presidential contender.
I used it far too often throughout the summer and fall of 2015, and started using it much less as the primaries got closer.

Remember when people used to think every bad thing Trump did was a calculated distraction from the last bad thing Trump did?
(To be clear, this is not a very likely scenario.)
Seems like the most likely pre-midterms impeachment scenario is Mitch McConnell deciding he's sick of dealing with Trump stuff.
But if this *does* end up being the breaking point for Repubs on Capitol Hill—a big if!—it'll likely be because of the threat of more memos.
Obviously Chaffetz has more flexibility since he's on his way out, so we'll have to watch for other GOP leaders' reactions over next 24 hrs.
RT @RosieGray: whoa https://t.co/J0mh883Kk0
One of the most predictable patterns of the Trump presidency has been congressional Repubs' reaction (or lack thereof) to these scandals.

On the eve of his 100th day in office, Trump appears to be spiraling into presidential status anxiety. My story: https://t.co/1BqkShiNie
Can't tell if I'm just in one of those moods where I read every Trump quote like it's dripping with pathos, or if he really sounds that sad.
To be fair, I'm sure every POTUS is humbled by the challenges of the office. But most prob didn't assume it'd be cushier than their last gig
Pilot, 45 minutes into 10-hour flight: "I have to confess, I didn't quite realize how complicated this would be..."
"I thought it would be easier" is really not what you're hoping to hear from the guy you just hired for the most important job in the world.
Promise him a spot on Mount Rushmore, doctor up some historically high approval ratings, and I bet you could convince Trump to retire now.
Oh man:

 https://t.co/t6v3fFUTKZ
After all the tough talk &amp; iconoclastic rhetoric during the campaign, Trump has been repeatedly brought to heel by the people he ran against
Meanwhile, every time Trump *does* pick a fight w/ establishment he loses, backs down, or gets distracted and wanders on to something else.
He's let GOP leaders in Congress effectively take over his agenda, and he's let establishment types talk him out of major campaign promises.
For a POTUS obsessed w/ asserting dominance/projecting strength, it's striking how many fights w/ "the swamp" Trump has lost in 1st 100 days
